This project was made by me and my 3 college colleagues, we were inspired by a personal difficulty of my grandmother, the problem was that by forgetfulness or a trend already, She left the access door to the house open and this facilitated the entry of those who were friends of their children or grandchildren, but when entering the house did not ask for permission and much less warn, because they are already accustomed to it, there have even been some robberies because of this situation. Given this, we developed an electronic lock of very low cost and easy deployment, which could work with magnetic card or even digital.
